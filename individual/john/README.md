## Timeline

### 11/17/2021

#### What we did
* TBD

#### Blockers
* TBD

#### What we will do next
* TBD


### 11/13/2021

#### What we did
* Identified all User Stories for what we will do in our project.
* Drilled down the details involved in each story, and identified corresponding tasks.
* I added all tasks to our Task Board and assigned as we agreed as a team.
* Discussed trade-offs with some tasks, determined which were high, medium and low priorities.

#### Blockers
* Still needed to determine whether we could render plain text as an overlay to the screens
or if we will need to generate graphical assets for each character we need to render.

#### What we will do next
* Work on our respective tasks.

### 11/10/2021

#### What we did
* Went over the possible enhancements we could pursue for the game. I provided my list of
  suggestions, and others provided theirs as well. We discussed relative merit of each and
  came up with a short list of the features we wanted to tackle.
#### Blockers
* None
#### What we will do next
* Create tickets for all the tasks will do, designate some of these to each of us. Start
  working on each.

### 11/05/2021

#### What we did
* Met with the team to decide on the Greenfoot game to use as starter code for our project.
  Discussed each person's suggestion, trade-offs, and potential feature enhancements.
* Demo'd my research into my suggestion, [P-TYPE](https://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/13388),
  the code structure of this game, the way I was able to use Intellij IDE to build the source
  (while testing runtime using the Greenfoot IDE), and the potential to build on top of it.
* Team made decision to go with my suggestion. We outlined the next set of goals we need to do,
  namely, reviewing the code, identifying potential enhancements & patterns we might employ,
  outlining User Stories and designating Tasks. We also created a Kanban board in Github
  and named our project *Q-TYPE*. 

#### Blockers
* Potentially, in determining the level of complexity of the tasks we will undertake.
* Investigating if we have the ability to overlay regular text onto the screens, or if we will
  need to generate font graphics as a way to overlay.

#### What we will do next
* Determine stories and tasks, designate them to each member so we can work in parallel.

### 11/04/2021

#### What we did
* Researched Greenfoot candidate games that I will suggest to build on top of. My choice is
  a game called [P-TYPE](https://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/13388), a space shoot-alien-ships game.
  I chose it because it looked to have a clean starting point, but also was missing some key
  aspects that we have the opportunity to develop. For example, no scores are provided, and
  there are only 2 levels. We could also potentially enhance the game dynamics with additional
  targets, patterns, effects, backgrounds, etc. Lastly, it may be good to provide a leaderboard.

#### Blockers
* Potentially whether the choices we are considering are good or not.

#### What we will do next
* Deciding on which game to pursue.

### 11/03/2021

#### What we did
* Meeting with the team
	* Discussed choices for our project: Greenfoot, Processing, or Custom Web/Mobile App.
	* Custom app may have been good to allow for different sub-systems for each to focus on.
    For example, one person to deal with the database and its data access layer, another
    person to build the NodeJS APIs, another for the UI and application logic, etc.
    However, determined that the time/scope of such work may not be optimal.
	* Considered Processing as well, but decided against it due to the limited Sktechpad IDE
    and the learning curve in using its abstractions.
	* Decided to pursue building/enhancing a game from Greenfoot. It was closer to using native
    Java, and already has a familiar dev environment from using BlueJ.
	* Each of us chose a XP Core Value to evangelize for the team. I chose Communication, since
    I was already facilitating the cadence of conversations, encouraging collaboration among
    all of us.

#### Blockers
* None

#### What we will do next
* Resolved to determine candidate games to consider for our next sync, so we can finalize
  which one to build on and enhance.


### 10/30/2021

#### What we did
* Prep for team syncs
	* Setup weekly meetings
	* Setup meeting doc

#### Blockers
* None

#### What we will do next
* Organize ourselves
* Understand the requirements

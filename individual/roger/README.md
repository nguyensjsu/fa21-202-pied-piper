### What we did

- Found games that we could work with

### What we are doing / what is stuck

- We decided on working on the P-Type Greenfoot game
  - This game is a simple skeleton that we will be able to build upon more easily than the more developed games that have been published.
  - The skeleton gives us room to decide on what features and patterns can be applied to the source code. 
- We listed out some features that we could work with
  - So far, the list of features is simple enough. Nothing is too complex.
  - However, some of them may not be necessary. I will discuss this next time. 
  
### What we will need to do

- Turn the features into user stories / use cases / tasks

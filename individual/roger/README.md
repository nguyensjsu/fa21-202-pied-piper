## 5 November 2021

### What we did

- Found games that we could work with

### What we are doing / what is stuck

- We decided on working on the P-Type Greenfoot game
  - This game is a simple skeleton that we will be able to build upon more easily than the more developed games that have been published.
  - The skeleton gives us room to decide on what features and patterns can be applied to the source code. 
- We listed out some features that we could work with
  - So far, the list of features is simple enough. Nothing is too complex.
  - However, some of them may not be necessary. I will discuss this next time. 
  
### What we will need to do

- Turn the features into user stories / use cases / tasks

### What we did

- John compiled some detailed notes on the features we may implement.

### What we are doing / what is stuck

- We went over John's notes and discussed them further.
  - I had to make sure that our plans are not too complicated.
  - I noted that we should focus on stories/features that would allow the implementation of patterns.
  - The tasks that are later drawn out should be reasonable and be completed within our limited time frame.
- We compliled a draft list of user stories
  - From the user stories we compiled a draft list of features that are derived from the stories

### What we will need to do

- Turn the features into tasks
- Delegate the tasks and label their priority levels
- Start working? (ASAP, since we are running out of time)

## 3 November 2021

### What we did

- Setup the git
- John prepared the initial documentation to help us get organized

### What we are doing / what is stuck

- We decided on building upon an existing Greenfoot Application
- We split up the XP Core values among the five of us (I have been assigned to "Simplicity")
  
### What we will need to do

- Decide on a specific Greenfoot application to build upon

## 5 November 2021

### What we did

- Found games that we could work with

### What we are doing / what is stuck

- We decided on working on the P-Type Greenfoot game
  - This game is a simple skeleton that we will be able to build upon more easily than the more developed games that have been published.
  - The skeleton gives us room to decide on what features and patterns can be applied to the source code. 
- We listed out some features that we could work with
  - So far, the list of features is simple enough. Nothing is too complex.
  - However, some of them may not be necessary. I will discuss this next time. 
  
### What we will need to do

- Turn the features into user stories / use cases / tasks

---

## 10 November 2021

### What we did

- John compiled some detailed notes on the features we may implement.

### What we are doing / what is stuck

- We went over John's notes and discussed them further.
  - I had to make sure that our plans are not too complicated.
  - I noted that we should focus on stories/features that would allow the implementation of patterns.
  - The tasks that are later drawn out should be reasonable and be completed within our limited time frame.
- We compliled a draft list of user stories
  - From the user stories we compiled a draft list of features that are derived from the stories

### What we will need to do

- Turn the features into tasks
- Delegate the tasks and label their priority levels
- Start working? (ASAP, since we are running out of time)

## 13 November 2021

### What we did

- Reviewed the extracted features and tasks

### What we are doing / what is stuck

- Assigning priority levels
- Delegated tasks for each member
  - I tried simplifying the requirements so that the tasks are achievable within reasonable time
  - Perhaps my direction is wrong, but I wanted to prioritize tasks that allowed for the implementation of a pattern
  - Although, some base features may need to be implemented before a pattern can be applied

### What we will need to do

- Start working on the assigned tasks for the week
  - The 5 starting items from the backlog have been moved to the TO-DO list.
  - I will be implementing the display of player lives and adding a score feature

---

## 17 November 2021

### What we did

- John created the base for the boss level. 
- Sid set up a base for the Settings page
- I have created a display for player lives using the observer pattern.

### What we are doing / what is stuck

- Sid continues to work on the Settings page by incorporating the buttons for volume
  - The game/intro volume are separate from the sound effects. 
  - Having one being adjustable is a good start.
  - We can leave sound effects as a separate, lower priority task.
- John continues to work on the Boss level.
  - I suggested that the boss level can just be a static level with just one boss enemy, just to simplify the task.
  - The level design will be left to his discretion. 
- Progress from Faizali is unknown at this point.
- Hashmitha has no access to the repo.

### What we will need to do

- I will clean up anything from the Life display code
- I need to start working on implementing player score and displaying it.

## 20 November 2021

### What we did

- John added a Debugger display on the screen
- Sid has successfully implemented buttons for volume adjustment
- I made code adjustments to the life display and fixed some bugs.

### What we are doing / what is stuck

- We are discussing what will need to be done next.
- I asked John about specifics in implementing the score. He helped in reminding me to keep things simple. 
- Faizali says he has something in the works for the Leaderboard.
  - I briefly discussed with him again on possible pattern implementations for the leaderboard.
  - It really depends on how Sid's finish screen will work and how it will cooperate with the leaderboard aspects.
- Hashmitha has not started any work yet.
  - Not sure if she has asked the professor about repo access.

### What we will need to do

- Sid will start working on the Finish screen.
- John will continue to make progress with the Boss level.
- I will start on the implementation of player score and displaying it.

## 30 November 2021

### What we did

- I updated the observer patterns to be more correct.

### What we are doing / what is stuck

- I am working on the pitch video.
- Sid is fixing bugs on the finish and leaderboard screens.
  - I think it is best, at this point, to focus on major bugs and not worry about the minor ones.

### What we will need to do

- Sid will continue to complete his parts.
- I will continue to work on the video.
